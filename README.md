# React Headless CMS Example Project

Code challenge project that I created for my dog. It combines modern libraries (React, GraphQl) with modern build techniques (webpack) and modern content managment systems (CraftCMS - Headless).

## Questions

Your welcome to clone or fork. There is an example Nginx config in the repo, but you will need to create an env file for Craft (example file included).
